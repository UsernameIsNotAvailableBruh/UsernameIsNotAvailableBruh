## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 17 year old coder in RI. I started coding when I was 14, in semester 1 of my freshman high school year. \
I usually code in Python.\
I have plans to learn/use C++, Rust, and Java. Currently, I'm learning Java in school and C++ online.\
\
Feedback is always appreciated! Thank you!
